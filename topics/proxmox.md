## Migrating to Proxmox

### Description

This details the process of migrating a virtual machine from an existing hypervisor to Proxmox.

### References

- [New Proxmox Import Wizard for Migrating VMware ESXi VMs](https://youtu.be/H1t6hxCoiZw)
- [Migrate to Proxmox VE](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Migrate_to_Proxmox_VE)

### Manual

This details how to migrate a virtual machine manually to Proxmox:

1. Export the source virtual machine's `*.vmdk` and `*-flat.vmdk` files to your client machine.

2. Send the files to a location accessible to the destination Proxmox node (i.e. `~`):

    ```sh
    scp *.vmdk root@<proxmox-host>:~
    ```

    Replace `<proxmox-host>` with the IP address or hostname of the Proxmox server (i.e. `192.168.0.106`)

3. On the Proxmox node, [create a new VM](#create-vm) with the specifications as close to the source virtual machine as possible, not using any media, and have its default disk **REMOVED**. Take note of the virtual machine's VM ID (i.e. `100`).

4. On the Proxmox server shell, import the `*.vmdk` file to the new target virtual machine:

   - Navigate to where the `*.vmdk` and `*-flat.vmdk` files are located (i.e. `~`):

      ```sh
      cd ~
      ```

   - Import the `*.vmdk` file to the target virtual machine:

      ```sh
      qm disk import <vmid> <vmdk-file> <storage>
      ```

     - Replace `<vmid>` with the ID of the target virtual machine (i.e. `100`)
     - Replace `<vmdk-file>` with the name of the target `*.vmdk` (**NOT** `*-flat.vmdk`) file (i.e. `my-server.vmdk`)
     - Replace `<storage>` with the name of the target storage (i.e. `local-zfs`)

   - If the target storage expects or stores disk images in a certain format, specify the format by adding the `--format` option to the same command:

      ```sh
      qm disk import <vmid> <vmdk-file> <storage> --format <format>
      ```

     - Replace `<format>` with the disk format the target storage expects (i.e. `raw`)

   - The full sample command should look something like this:

      ```sh
      qm disk import 100 my-server.vmdk local-zfs --format raw
      ```

   - If the import was successful, it should return an output similar to the following:

      ```sh
      Successfully imported disk as 'unused0:local-zfs:vm-100-disk-0'
      ```

   - If the source virtual machine has multiple disks, repeat the import process for each disk's `*.vmdk` file. For example:

      ```sh
      qm disk import 100 my-server_1.vmdk local-zfs --format raw
      ```

5. Once the import is done, [update](#editing-vm-parameters) each imported disk (i.e. `Unused Disk 0`) in the **Hardware** section of the target machine:

   - Make any configuration to the **Add: Unused Disk** form if necessary.
   - Click the **Add** button to attach the disk to the target machine.

6. [Update](#editing-vm-parameters) the **Boot Order** in the **Options** section of the target machine and ensure the boot or primary storage device (i.e. `scsi0`) is enabled and first in order.

7. Carry out the [Post-Migration](#post-migration) process to ensure the VM is properly configured.

8. Once the imported VM is up and running, you may delete the imported `*.vmdk` and `*-flat.vmdk` files from the Proxmox node:

    ```sh
    rm -f ~/*.vmdk
    ```

### ESXi

This process details how to migrate a virtual machine from an ESXi hypervisor to Proxmox:

1. Launch the Proxmox Virtual Environment web interface on a web browser.

2. On the left-hand side of the web interface, select the **Datacenter** menu item.

3. In the Datacenter view, click the **Storage** menu option.

4. In the Storage section, click the **Add** button to expand the dropdown and select the **ESXi** option.

5. In the **Add: ESXi** form, configure the following:

   - ID: Add a unique, descriptive ID for the ESXi storage (i.e. `esxi`)
   - Server: Add the IP address of the ESXi node (i.e. `192.168.0.106`)
   - Username: Add the administrator username of the ESXi node (i.e. `root`)
   - Password: Add the administrator password of the ESXi node
   - Skip Certificate Verification: Check the box to avoid issues with the possibly self-signed certificate

    Click the **Add** button.

    > Please ensure that the VM you are importing is not in a running state (on the ESXi server)!

8. In the **Import Guest** form, configure the following:

   - **General**:

     - VM ID: Set this to an unused index (i.e. `101`)
     - Name: Set a suitable name for the VM (i.e. `my-vm.example.com`)
     - CPU Type: Expand the dropdown and select the CPU type you wish for the VM to use or emulate depending on your CPU and requirements (i.e. `x86-64-v3`)
     - OS Type: Expand the dropdown and select the type of OS the VM runs (i.e. `Linux`)

   - **Advanced**:

     - SCSI Controller: Expand the dropdown and select the SCSI controller you wish to use (i.e. `VirtIO SCSI single`)
     - Network Interface Model: Expand the dropdown and select the network model you wish to use (i.e. `VirtIO (paravirtualized)`)

   - Configure the rest of the settings as you see fit or leave them as default. Click the **Import** button once done.

9. In the **Task viewer** window, wait for the import to complete. Once it has, close the window by clicking its **X** button.

10. Once the VM has been imported, you will find the VM listed on the left-hand side of the web interface, under the group denoted by the name of your Proxmox server (i.e. `proxmox`). Select the VM.

11. [Edit the VM](#editing-vm-parameters)'s following configurations found in the **Options** menu:

    - Boot Order: Ensure the boot storage device (i.e. `scsi0`) is enabled and first in order
    - QEMU Guest Agent: Check the box to enable the QEMU Guest Agent

12. Carry out the [Post-Migration](#post-migration) process to ensure the VM is properly configured.

### Post-Migration

This process details some configuration options to a virtual machine that has just been imported to Proxmox:

1. [Enter the VM](#enter-the-vm) to do some [configuration](linux.md#configuration) according to the target guest OS.

2. In some cases, you may need to configure the existing network configuration which still expects its old network interface (from ESXi) to be available:

   - Run the following command to determine its new network interface:

      ```sh
      ip link
      ```

   - In this sample output, the right network interface is `enp6s18`:

      ```
      1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
          link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
      2: enp6s18: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
          link/ether fg:LA:Og:mQ:LQ:7Q brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
      ```

      Replace any possible mention of the old network interface (i.e. `ens192`) in the VM's network configuration with the new one.

3. [Install](package-manager.md#install-software) packages required by Proxmox using the system package manager (i.e. `apt`):

   - `qemu-guest-agent`

4. Additionally, you may also [uninstall](package-manager.md#remove-software) packages that are no longer required using the system package manager (i.e. `apt`):

   - `open-vm-tools`

## PCIe Passthrough

### Description

This details the process of passing through PCIe devices to a virtual machine in Proxmox.

- [Determine which Bootloader is Used](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Host_Bootloader#sysboot_determine_bootloader_used)

### Enablement

This process details how to enable PCIe passthrough in Proxmox:

1. On the Proxmox node, determine the bootloader used:

    ```sh
    efibootmgr -v
    ```

   - If the output shows something like the following:

      ```
      BootCurrent: 0002
      ```

      ```
      Boot0002* Linux Boot Manager    HD(2,GPT,aqxk1iaf-t8fe-2hoz-iz2i-ycetxczlsftm,0x800,0x200000)/File(\EFI\SYSTEMD\SYSTEMD-BOOTX64.EFI)
      ```

      It means that the bootloader is Systemd-boot. Otherwise, assume it is GRUB.

2. Update the kernel command line according to the bootloader used. To do so:

   - Systemd-boot:

      ```sh
      nano /etc/kernel/cmdline
      ```

     - Append the required argument(s) to the end of the first line. For example:

        ```diff
        - root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/pve-1 boot=zfs
        + root=ZFS=rpool/ROOT/pve-1 boot=zfs sample_arg=sample_value
        ```

     - Save and apply the changes after updating the kernel command line:

        ```sh
        proxmox-boot-tool refresh
        ```

   - GRUB:

      ```sh
      nano /etc/default/grub
      ```

     - Append the required argument(s) to the end of the value of the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable. For example:

        ```diff
        - GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"
        + GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet sample_arg=sample_value"
        ```

     - Save and apply the changes after updating the kernel command line:

        ```sh
        update-grub
        ```

3. Enable IOMMU according to your CPU by adding the following value to the kernel command line:

   - Intel:

      ```sh
      intel_iommu=on
      ```

   - AMD:

      ```sh
      amd_iommu=on
      ```

4. Enable IOMMU Passthrough mode for increased performance for supported hardware:

    Add the following option to the kernel command line:

    ```sh
    iommu=pt
    ```

5. Load the following kernel modules to enable support for hardware passthrough:

    ```sh
    nano /etc/modules
    ```

   - Add the following kernel modules to the file:

      ```diff
        # /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
        #
        # This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
        # at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
        # Parameters can be specified after the module name.
      + vfio
      + vfio_iommu_type1
      + vfio_pci
      + # vfio_virqfd # not needed if on kernel 6.2 or newer
      ```

      Save the changes made to the updated file:

      ```sh
      # /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
      #
      # This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
      # at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
      # Parameters can be specified after the module name.
      vfio
      vfio_iommu_type1
      vfio_pci
      # vfio_virqfd # not needed if on kernel 6.2 or newer
      ```

   - Refresh the `initramfs` after adding the new kernel modules:

      ```sh
      update-initramfs -u -k all
      ```

   - Verify that the modules we have added are loaded:

      ```sh
      lsmod | grep vfio
      ```

      Sample output:

      ```sh
      vfio_pci               16384  0
      vfio_pci_core          86016  1 vfio_pci
      irqbypass              12288  2 vfio_pci_core,kvm
      vfio_iommu_type1       49152  0
      vfio                   65536  3 vfio_pci_core,vfio_iommu_type1,vfio_pci
      iommufd                94208  1 vfio
      ```

6. Reboot the Proxmox node for all changes to take effect. After rebooting, verify that all the required features have been enabled:

      ```sh
      dmesg | grep -e DMAR -e IOMMU -e AMD-Vi
      ```

      Sample output:

      ```sh
      [    0.000000] AMD-Vi: Unknown option - 'on'
      [    0.000000] AMD-Vi: Using global IVHD EFR:0xf77ef22294ada, EFR2:0x0
      [    0.325658] pci 0000:00:00.2: AMD-Vi: IOMMU performance counters supported
      [    0.327225] AMD-Vi: Extended features (0xf77ef22294ada, 0x0): PPR NX GT IA GA PC GA_vAPIC
      [    0.327244] AMD-Vi: Interrupt remapping enabled
      [    0.327388] AMD-Vi: Virtual APIC enabled
      [    0.327499] perf/amd_iommu: Detected AMD IOMMU #0 (2 banks, 4 counters/bank).
      ```

### Adding to VM

This details how to configure a virtual machine to pass through a PCIe device:

1. [Create a virtual machine](#create-vm-from-container-template) or [update](#editing-vm-parameters) an existing one with the following considerations:

   - **System**:
     - Machine: Expand the dropdown and select the machine type (chipset) that matches your Proxmox node (i.e. `q35`)
     - BIOS: Expand the dropdown and select the right BIOS type according to your selected **Machine** (i.e. `OVMF (UEFI)`)
   - **Memory**:
     - Ballooning Device: Uncheck the box to disable it as required by hardware passthrough which is memory address based

2. Once the virtual machine has been created or updated, [add a PCI Device](#adding-a-device) to the virtual machine with the following configurations:

   - Mapped Device: If you are passing through a device that has shareable resources like certain video cards and network cards, check this box to enable it
   - Raw Device: If you are passing through a device as a whole, check this box to enable it
   - Device: Expand the dropdown and select the PCI device you wish to add

3. [Enter the virtual machine](#enter-the-vm) and verify that the device has been passed through:

    ```sh
    lspci
    ```

    From the output, locate the PCI device you have added.
