## Setup

### Description

This details the process of setting up Proxmox including installation and configuration.

### References

- [Let's Install Proxmox 8.0!](https://youtu.be/sZcOlW-DwrU)

### Installation

1. Boot into the Proxmox Virtual Environment installer ISO off of a USB stick.

2. In the Proxmox Virtual Environment welcome page, select the **Install Proxmox VE (Graphical)** option.

3. When prompted with the End User License Agreement (EULA) page, click the **I agree** button.

4. Expand the **Target Harddisk** dropdown and select the intended drive to install Proxmox to (i.e. `/dev/nvme0n1`).

    **Optionally**, you may also click the **Options** button to configure additional **Harddisk options** such as selecting a Filesystem (i.e. `zfs (RAID1)`), etc.

    Click the **Next** button once complete.

5. In the **Location and Time Zone selection** page, set the intended **Country**, **Time zone** and **Keyboard Layout** of your choosing.

6. In the **Administration Password and Email Address** page, set the intended **Password** (with confirmation) and **Email** of your choosing.

7. In the **Management Network Configuration** page, configure the following settings:

   - Expand the **Management Interface** dropdown and select the right wired or wireless interface (i.e. `enp4s0`)
   - **Hostname (FQDN)**: Set a suitable hostname to the Proxmox server (i.e. `proxmox.example.com`)
   - **IP Address (CIDR)**: Set a static IP for the Proxmox server (i.e. `192.168.0.106/24`)
   - **Gateway**: Set the local gateway of your network (i.e. `192.168.0.1`)
   - **DNS Server**: Set the DNS server you wish to use (i.e. `1.1.1.1`)

    Click the **Next** button

8. In the **Summary** page, review your installation options, check the **Automatically reboot after successful installation** box, and click the **Install** button.

9. Wait for the installation to complete. Once it has, the Proxmox Virtual Environment web interface will be accessible on a browser at the server's IP address and port 8006 (i.e. `https://192.168.0.106:8006`).

### Configuration

1. Launch the Proxmox Virtual Environment web interface on a web browser.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If met with a **Potential Security Risk Ahead** warning, bypass it by selecting the **Advanced...** and **Accept the Risk and Continue** option.

2. At the prompted **Proxmox VE Login** window, fill in your credentials, check the **Save User name** box, and click the **Login** button.

    > [!TIP]  
    > If met with a **No valid subscription** warning, simply click the **OK** button to dismiss it.

3. If you have no valid [licensing subscription](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/pricing) (which is entirely optional), you may want to disable any default `Enterprise` package repositories supplied by Proxmox and replace them with their `No-Subscription` counterparts:

   - On the left-hand side of the web interface, under **Datacenter**, click the name of your Proxmox node (i.e. `proxmox`).

   - In the node's available menu options, expand the **Updates** group and click the **Repositories** section.

   - In the **APT Repositories** page, if they are enabled, select each of these repositories and click the **Disable** button:

     - https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/ceph-quincy
     - https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve

   - After disabling them, click the **Add** button, expand and select a **Repository**, and click the **Add** button to enable it.

      Do so for each of these repositories:

     - `No-Subscription`
     - `Ceph Quincy No-Subscription`

    Click the **Next** button.

10. Under the **Confirm** tab, review the VM configuration, optionally enable the **Start after created** option, and click the **Finish** button.

11. [Enter the VM](#enter-the-vm) and go through the OS installation process. Refer to the [Linux installation](linux.md#installation) topic for more installation details for Linux based VMs.

12. Once finished installing, if the guest OS asks you to remove the installation medium before rebooting, from the virtual machine view, navigate to the **Hardware** section.

13. Select the **CD/DVD Drive** containing the installation medium or ISO and click the **Edit** button.

14. Select the **Do not use any media** option and click the **OK** button to remove the ISO from the virtual CD/DVD Drive.

16. [Configure](#vm-configuration) the VM as necessary.

### Enter the VM

This details how to enter a virtual machine on Proxmox.

1. Launch the Proxmox Virtual Environment web interface on a web browser.

2. Select the target virtual machine (illustrated with an icon of a display) you wish to enter.

3. In the virtual machine view, click the **Start** button located at the top right corner if the VM is not already running.

4. In the **Summary** section of the VM, there should be an **IPs** attribute containing the VM's IP address. If it does not (i.e. says **Guest Agent not running**), it's possible that the VM has not been setup or `qemu-guest-agent` is not installed.

5. If you know the IP of the virtual machine, you may simply access it through [SSH]() from your personal machine for the best convenience and experience.

6. **Alternatively**, if you need to access it directly through Proxmox, navigate to the **Console** section and use the VM that way.

### VM Configuration

This details some generic configuration recommendations for a virtual machine after it's been [created and installed](#create-vm):

- Perform a system update on the VM
- Install the [`qemu-guest-agent`](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Qemu-guest-agent) package on the VM to allow useful Proxmox VM management features
- [Enable SSH](ssh.md#enable-remote-access) on the VM
- **(Optional)** Change the default SSH port on the VM
- **(Optional)** Disable root login for SSH on the VM
- **(Optional)** Disable password authentication for SSH on the VM
- **(Optional)** Set up a firewall on the VM (allow traffic to the new SSH port if it's been updated)

For more detailed instructions on configuring a Linux based virtual machine, please refer to the [Linux configuration](linux.md#configuration) topic according to the guest OS.

### Create Container Template

This details how to create a Container Template out of a virtual machine.

1. Launch the Proxmox Virtual Environment web interface on a web browser.

2. Select the target virtual machine (illustrated with an icon of a display) you wish to turn to a Container Template. [Create](#create-vm) the virtual machine if you have not already.

3. In the virtual machine view, expand the **More** dropdown located at the top right corner and select the **Convert to template** option.

### Create VM From Container Template

This details how to create a virtual machine or Container Template from a backup.

1. On the left-hand side of the web interface, under **Datacenter**, expand the section belonging to your Proxmox node (i.e. `proxmox`).

2. Select the target Container Template (illustrated with an icon of a file and display) you wish to use as a base for your new virtual machine.

3. In the Container Template view, expand the **More** dropdown located at the top right corner and select the **Clone** option.

4. In the **Clone VM Template** window, configure the following options:

   - Target node: Set this to your Proxmox node (i.e. `proxmox`)
   - VM ID: Set this to an unused index (i.e. `101`)
   - Name: Set a suitable name for the VM (i.e. `my-vm.example.com`)
   - Mode: Expand the dropdown and select the `Full Clone` option
   - **(Target Storage)**: Expand the dropdown and select the storage where you wish to install the VM on (Defaults to `Same as source`)

   Click the **Clone** button.

5. Wait for the cloning process to complete (i.e. when the lock icon on the newly created VM disappears).

6. Once the VM has been created, you may start using the VM by selecting the VM entry under the Proxmox node and click the **Start** button in its corresponding view.

### Editing VM Parameters

This details how to edit an existing virtual machine or Container Template.

1. On the left-hand side of the web interface, under **Datacenter**, expand the section belonging to your Proxmox node (i.e. `proxmox`).

2. Select the target virtual machine (illustrated with an icon of a display) or Container Template (illustrated with an icon of a file and display) you wish to edit.

3. In the virtual machine view, go through any of the available sections such as **Hardware**, **Cloud-Init**, or **Options** and find parameters you wish to update.

4. To update a VM parameter, select to highlight the particular parameter (i.e. **Memory**) and click the **Edit** button.

5. In the parameter's **Edit** window, make any changes to the parameter value. Some parameters may have an **Advanced** option box you are able to check to enable.
