# Arch Linux

## Description

Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.

## Configuration

### Description

This details some recommended configuration options for Arch Linux as a server.

### Base VM

1. [Configure `pacman`](package-manager.md#configuration) to initialise the system keyring, update the mirror list, and enable parallel downloads.

2. Perform a [full system upgrade](package-manager.md#update-software) on the system using `pacman`.

3. [Create a service user](#create-user) on the system if there isn't one already and [grant it sudo privileges](#sudo).

4. [Install](package-manager.md#install-software) the following packages using `pacman`:

   - `base-devel`
   - `curl`
   - `git`
   - `htop`
   - `inetutils`
   - `nano`
   - `net-tools`
   - `openssh`
   - `pciutils`
   - `python`
   - `python-pip`
   - `rsync`
   - `vim`
   - `wget`

5. **(VM Only)** [Install](package-manager.md#install-software) packages required by your [hypervisor](../courses/hypervisor.md) using `pacman`:

   - ESXi: `open-vm-tools`
   - Proxmox: `qemu-guest-agent`

        > [!TIP]  
        > On Proxmox, you may also need to [enable](systemd.md#enable-service) the `qemu-guest-agent` service yourself.

6. [Clean up](package-manager.md#clean-up) the system using `pacman` to recover some storage space.

7. [Enable the SSH service](ssh.md#enable-remote-access) (if it is not already enabled).

8. [Copy over your public SSH key(s)](ssh.md#copy-ssh-keys) to the system.

9. Decide on a new SSH port (i.e. `2222`) to replace the default port, `22`.

10. Update the VM's [SSH configuration](ssh.md#configuration), which includes:

    - Changing the default SSH port to a new port (i.e. `2222`).

    - Disabling root login via SSH.

    - Disabling password authentication via SSH.

      > [!WARNING]  
      > Make sure you have [copied over your public SSH key(s)](ssh.md#copy-ssh-keys) to the system before applying this change!

11. Set up the VM firewall (Firewalld):

    - [Install](package-manager.md#install-software) the `firewalld` package using `pacman`.

    - [Enable the firewall](firewall.md#enablement).

    - Check the [firewall status](firewall.md#status) to ensure it is active.

    - [Allow the connection](firewall.md#adding-allow-rule) to the new SSH port (i.e. `2222`) using the `tcp` protocol.

    - [Remove the (default) firewall rule](firewall.md#delete-rule) allowing the old SSH port using its service name, `ssh`.

12. **(Optional)** [Install and set up `yay`](package-manager.md#setup) as an alternative package manager to `pacman` to get easy access to the packages in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org).

13. Clear the VM's Bash history:

    ```sh
    history -c
    cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && history -w
    ```

    > [!NOTE]  
    > There should be no other active sessions on the VM while doing this.

14. Reboot the VM to apply all changes:

    ```sh
    sudo reboot now
    ```

### Extended VM

These configuration options are expected to be applied on top of the changes that were made to the [base VM](#base-vm) inherited by the extended VM:

1. Perform a [full system upgrade](package-manager.md#update-software) on the system using `pacman` or `yay`, especially if it's been a while since the base VM was last upgraded.

2. [Set a static IP address and update the DNS server](#set-static-ip-and-update-dns) for the VM.

3. [Update the system hostname](#update-hostname).

---

## Networking

> [!NOTE]  
> Proxmox [LXC Containers](proxmox.md#linux-containers-lxc) have their own, much easier way of managing these settings graphically. If you choose to configure them manually, [make sure they persist](proxmox.md#persist-configurations-in-lxc).

### Description

This details the process of updating certain networking configurations on the system.

### References

- [Network files](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd-networkd#network_files)
- [hosts(5)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/hosts.5.en)

### Set Static IP and Update DNS

This details the process of setting a static IP address and updating the DNS server on a system.

1. Determine the name of the active network interface on the system:

    ```sh
    route | grep '^default' | grep -o '[^ ]*$'
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```
    enp6s18
    ```

    **Alternatively**, you may also use the following command:

    ```sh
    ip link
    ```

    Sample output:

    ```
    1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    2: enp6s18: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether fg:LA:Og:mQ:LQ:7Q brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    ```

    In this example, `enp6s18` is the name of the active network interface.

2. Create a network configuration file:

    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/10-wired.network
    ```

    > [!TIP]  
    > The `wired` part of the name is arbitrary. Feel free to change it with something more or as descriptive (i.e. the name of the network interface).

3. Update the configuration as such:

    Add the following lines with your values:

    ```conf
    [Match]
    Name=<network-interface>

    [Network]
    DHCP=no
    Address=<ip-address>/24
    Gateway=<gateway>
    DNS=<dns1>
    DNS=<dns2>
    ```

    The following is an example of the updated configuration:

    ```conf
    [Match]
    Name=enp6s18

    [Network]
    DHCP=no
    Address=192.168.0.106/24
    Gateway=192.168.0.1
    DNS=1.1.1.1
    DNS=8.8.8.8
    ```

4. Save all changes made to the file and apply the new configuration by [enabling](systemd.md#enable-service) and [restarting](systemd.md#restart-service) the following services:

   - `systemd-networkd.service`
   - `systemd-resolved.service`

### Update Hostname

This details the simple process of updating system's hostname:

1. Update the system's hostname using `hostnamectl`:

    ```sh
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "<hostname>.<domain>"
    ```

    As an example, if the new `<hostname>` is `arch-1` and the `<domain>` is `example.com`:

    ```sh
    sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "arch-1.example.com"
    ```

2. **(Optional)** Update the system's hosts file:

    ```sh
    sudo nano /etc/hosts
    ```

    Sample of the original hosts file:

    ```
    # Static table lookup for hostnames.
    # See hosts(5) for details.
    ```

    As an example, set the hostname to `arch-1` and update the hosts file with these changes:

    ```diff
    # Static table lookup for hostnames.
    # See hosts(5) for details.
    + 127.0.0.1       localhost
    + 127.0.1.1       arch-1.example.com arch-1
    +
    + # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
    + ::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    + ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    + ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
    ```

    Sample of the updated hosts file:

    ```
    # Static table lookup for hostnames.
    # See hosts(5) for details.
    127.0.0.1       localhost
    127.0.1.1       arch-1.example.com arch-1

    # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
    ::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
    ```

3. Reboot the VM to apply the changes:

    ```sh
    sudo reboot now
    ```

## User Management

### Description

This details topics pertaining to user and group management on the system.

### References

- [Example adding a user](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Users_and_groups#Example_adding_a_user)

### Create User

This details how to create a service user on the system:

1. As the `root` user, run the following command to create a user:

    ```sh
    useradd -m <username>
    ```

    For example, if the username of the service user is `foo`:

    ```sh
    useradd -m foo
    ```

2. After the user has been created, provide a secure password for the user:

    ```sh
    passwd <username>
    ```

    For example, if the username of the service user is `foo`:

    ```sh
    passwd foo
    ```

### Create Group

This details how to create a group on the system:

1. With root privileges, run the following command to create a group:

   - Replace `<group>` with the name of the group:

      ```sh
      groupadd <group>
      ```

      For example, if the group name is `bar`:

      ```sh
      groupadd bar
      ```

   - If the group needs a specific group ID (GID), add the `-g` flag to the same command:

      ```sh
      groupadd <group> -g <gid>
      ```

      Replace `<gid>` with the intended GID value for the group (i.e. `1001`).

2. Verify that the group has been created:

   - Replace `<group>` with the name of the group:

      ```sh
      cat /etc/group | grep <group>
      ```

      For example, if the group name is `bar`:

      ```sh
      cat /etc/group | grep bar
      ```

   - Sample output:

      ```
        bar:x:1001:
      ```

      Based on the sample output, this tells that the group (i.e. `bar`) has been created.

### Add User to Group

This details how to add a user to a specific group:

1. As the `root` user, run the following command to add a user to a group:

    ```sh
    usermod -aG <group> <username>
    ```

    For example, if the username of the service user is `foo` and the group is `bar`:

    ```sh
    usermod -aG bar foo
    ```

2. Verify that the user has been added to the group:

   - Replace `<username>` with the username of the service user:

      ```sh
      id <username>
      ```

      For example, if the username of the service user is `foo`:

      ```sh
      id foo
      ```

   - Sample output:

      ```
        uid=1000(<username>) gid=1000(<username>) groups=1000(<username>),999(<group>)
      ```

      Based on the output, ensure that the user (i.e. `foo`) has the group (i.e. `bar`) added to their `groups` list.

## Sudo

### Description

This details the process of granting temporary superuser (sudo) privileges to a user.

### Steps

1. Switch to the `root` user if you are not logged in as root:

    ```sh
    su -
    ```

    Proceed with the rest of the following steps as root.

2. [Install](package-manager.md#install-software) the `sudo` package using `pacman` if it is not already installed.

3. Grant sudo privileges to all members of the `wheel` group on the system:

   - Run the following command to safely update the configuration file using `nano`:

      ```sh
      EDITOR=nano visudo
      ```

   - Locate and uncomment the following line to allow members of the `wheel` group to use `sudo` to execute any command:

      ```diff
        ## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
      - # %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
      + %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
      ```

      Sample resulting configuration:

      ```
      ## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
      %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
      ```

   - Save changes made to the configuration file.

1. [Create a service user](#create-user) that is to be granted sudo privileges if you have not already.

2. [Add the service user to the `wheel` group](#add-user-to-group) to give them sudo privileges.

3. Log out and log back in to apply and test the changes:

   - Press <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> to log out of the root user.
   - Press <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> again if you are logged in as the service user.
   - Log back in as the service user.
   - As the service user, execute a command that requires root privileges using `sudo`.
