## Systemctl Usage

### Description

This details how to use the `systemctl` command to manage services on a Linux system.

### References

- [Basic systemctl usage](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd#Basic_systemctl_usage)

### Steps

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following examples, we'll assume the name of the service is `unit.service`. Replace it with the actual name of the service you wish to manage.

### Start Service

1. To start a service, once, now:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl start unit.service
    ```

### Enable Service

1. To enable a service to start on every boot:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl enable unit.service
    ```

2. **Alternatively**, to start a service now and enable the service on boot in a single command:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl enable --now unit.service
    ```

### Stop Service

1. To stop a service, once, now:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl stop unit.service
    ```

### Disable Service

1. To disable an enabled service from starting on every boot:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl disable unit.service
    ```

### Restart Service

1. To restart a service, useful for applying changes to certain services:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart unit.service
    ```

### Service Status

1. To check the status of a service:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl status unit.service
    ```

### Reload Systemd Manager Configuration

Some operations may require reloading the `systemd` manager configuration.

1. To reload the `systemd` manager configuration:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
