## Setup

### Description

This details how to install and set up a Portainer server in a containerised environment.

### Installation

This details how to install Portainer as a Docker container:

1. On a [preconfigured Linux machine](linux.md#configuration) running on a [virtual machine](../courses/vm.md#creating-a-virtual-machine-from-a-template), bare metal device (i.e. [Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md)), or perhaps an [LXC Container](../courses/container.md#linux-containers-lxc); ensure that [Docker is installed and set up](../courses/container.md#setting-up-docker). For simplicity, the following considerations should be noted:

   - Ports that will be used and requires allowing vary for each container you host on the Portainer server, hence, it is recommended not to enable or set up a firewall on the system.

2. [Deploy the Portainer stack with Docker Compose](../courses/container.md#docker-usage) after preparing the following items:

   - A local app directory, on local storage (i.e. `~/.local/share/docker/portainer`) or a remote app directory, on remote mounted storage (i.e. `/mnt/smb/docker/portainer`): This will be used for the Portainer stack's volume(s).

   - A Docker compose file for the Portainer stack on the app directory (i.e. `/mnt/smb/docker/portainer/docker-compose.yml`):

      ```yaml
      name: portainer
      services:
        portainer:
          container_name: portainer
          image: docker.io/portainer/portainer-ce:${PORTAINER_VERSION}
          ports:
            - 8000:8000
            - 9443:9443
            - 9000:9000 # for http
          volumes:
            - ${APP_DIR}/data:/data
            - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
          networks:
            default:
          restart: unless-stopped
          security_opt:
            - no-new-privileges:true

      networks:
        default:
      ```

   - An env file for the Portainer stack on the app directory (i.e. `/mnt/smb/docker/portainer/.env`):

      ```sh
      PORTAINER_VERSION=2.27.8
      APP_DIR=/mnt/smb/docker/portainer
      ```

      Replace the values with your own accordingly.

### Post-Install Setup

This details the post-installation steps of the Portainer stack for a complete setup:

1. Launch the Portainer server web interface at `http://<portainer-server-host>:9000` (i.e. `http://192.168.0.106:9000`) on a web browser.

2. For the initial launch of the Portainer web interface, under the **New Portainer installation** section, fill in the following information in the provided form:

   - Username: Set a unique, descriptive username for the Portainer user (i.e. `admin`)
   - Password: Set a secure password for the Portainer user
   - Confirm password: Confirm the password you have set for the Portainer user

   Submit the form by clicking the **Create user** button.

3. In the **Quick Setup** page, click the **Get Started** button to "proceed using the local environment which Portainer is running in".

4. In the **Home** page, under the **Environments** section, click the **local** environment.

5. Going forward, [anything you do](#usage) pertaining to your Portainer environment could be done from the selected environment's **Dashboard** page here.

## Usage

### Description

This details some common usage steps for managing containers and application stacks in a Portainer environment.

### Deploying Containers

This details how to deploy or update container(s) in an application stack:

1. From the selected environment's **Dashboard** page, click the **Stacks** menu option.

2. From the **Stacks list** view in the **Stacks** page, click the **Add stack** button to add a new application stack. **Alternatively**, select the **Name** link corresponding to the application stack you wish to update.

3. If you are adding a new stack, in the **Create stack** form, configure the following:

   - Name: Set a unique, descriptive name for the application stack (i.e. `myapp`)
   - Build method: Select the **Web editor** menu option to define the Docker compose and env file from the web interface

    **Alternatively**, if you are updating an existing stack, in the **Stack details** view, click the **Editor** section.

4. In the provided **Web editor** for the application stack, define or update the content of its Docker Compose file. For example:

    ```yaml
    services:
      myapp:
        container_name: myapp
        image: docker.io/myuser/myapp:${APP_VERSION}
        ports:
          - ${HOST_PORT}:${APP_PORT}
        environment:
          - TZ=${APP_TIMEZONE}
        volumes:
          - ${APP_DIR}/config:/config
        restart: unless-stopped
        security_opt:
          - no-new-privileges:true
    ```

5. **(Optional)** Create an env file (`stack.env`) for the application stack by expanding the **Environment variables** section (if it is collapsed), clicking the **Advanced mode** link, and define or update the content of the env file using the provided editor accordingly. For example:

    ```sh
    APP_VERSION=0.1.0
    HOST_PORT=8000
    APP_PORT=8000
    APP_TIMEZONE=Etc/UTC
    APP_DIR=~/.local/share/myapp
    ```

6. **(Optional)** In the **Access control** section, enable the switch corresponding to the **Enable access control** option to control access to the application stack. **Alternatively**, if you are updating an existing stack, click the **Change ownership** link in the same section.

7. Under the **Actions** section, click the **Deploy the stack** button to deploy the application stack for the first time. **Alternatively**, click the **Update the stack** button if you are updating an existing stack.

### Entering Containers

This details how to enter the container(s) in an application stack:

1. From the selected environment's **Dashboard** page, click the **Containers** menu option.

2. From the **Container list** view in the **Containers** page, select the **Name** link corresponding to the container you wish to enter.

3. In the container's **Container details** view, under the **Container status** section, click the **Console** link.

4. In the container's **Container console** view, under the **Execute** section, configure the following:

   - Command: Expand the dropdown and select the intended shell option (i.e. `/bin/bash`)
   - Use custom command: **Alternatively**, check the corresponding switch to enable this option and fill in the **Command** field with the intended custom command (i.e. `ps aux`)
   - User: Set a specific user to enter the container as or leave as default (i.e. `root`)

    Click the **Connect** button.

5. Once you have done what you needed to do in the container, click the **Disconnect** button to exit the container.
